# Etch-a-Sketch

## Objective

Etch-a-Sketch is cool browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch, showcasing DOM manipulation. When a user hovers over a square, the square will change color, leaving a (pixelated) trail trough the grid like a pen would.

Project was created as part of The Odin Project course.
